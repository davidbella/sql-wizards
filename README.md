### New Update
I want to revisit this a little bit and clean it up. Looks like the code diverged from the tests pretty heavily so I'll look into fixing that up first, along with cleaning up the test suite in general, since I'm sure that it will need some updates.

### Legacy Note from Last Year

Inspired by the SQL lessons at Flatiron, I want to create a simple text based game based on _WIZARD BATTLES_.

I'm going to build this fully test driven, since I have never done that before at all. I'm not going to bother with most of the database stuff though, I will handle creation stuff outside of Ruby. I may end up testing some of the SQL interactions but I don't know.

A high level description of the project: A SQL database will track a list of Wizards. One of which can be selected to be your very own wizard to fight with. A command line REPL will provide you with interaction and allow you to select your wizard, start a fight, fight, etc.

Oh, by the way, these wizards are all super clumsy and are really bad at fighting.
